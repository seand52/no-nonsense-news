      "bodyTextSummary": "Drug safety experts in the UK believe there could be a causal link between the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid jab and very rare blood clots but say vaccination programmes must continue, with risk mitigation for women under 55. Prof Saad Shakir, the director of the drug safety research unit (DSRU) at Southampton University, said the evidence accumulated in Europe and the UK “is consistent with causality”. While the dangers of coronavirus are so great that vaccination must not stop, he said, measures should be put in place to reduce any extra risk to women under the age of 55, who seem to be most affected.\nThe Southampton University unit has shared its analysis of the cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in Europe and the UK with the regulators. The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are doing their own reviews and considering whether any action should be taken. On Tuesday, the EMA denied it has already established a causal connection between the vaccine and the rare blood clotting syndrome after a senior official from the agency said there was a link. Marco Cavaleri, the EMA’s head of vaccines, had earlier told Italy’s Il Messaggero newspaper that in his opinion “we can say it now, it is clear there is a link with the vaccine … but we still do not know what causes this reaction”. Across Europe, some countries have already decided to give the AstraZeneca jab only to older people – over 60 in Germany and over 55 in France – while in others the use of the vaccine is still suspended. The DSRU at Southampton University looked at cases of thrombosis (blood clotting inside the arteries) linked to thrombocytopenia (a reduction in blood platelets that usually causes bleeding but in rare cases results in clotting) and concluded that they were linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThe events are very rare, however. In the UK, as of 24 March, 30 events had occurred resulting in seven deaths from 18.1m doses of vaccine, they said. In Germany, there was one event of cerebral venous thrombosis for every 46,512 women vaccinated and one female death associated with this condition for every 149,860 vaccine doses given to women of any age.

A group of German scientists led by the clotting specialist Andreas Greinacher of the University of Greifswald has already pointed out that the blood clotting events reported after the AstraZeneca jab look very similar to HIT.
