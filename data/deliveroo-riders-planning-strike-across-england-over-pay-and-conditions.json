      "bodyTextSummary": "About 400 Deliveroo riders are expected to strike over pay and conditions as the company faces increasing pressure over its employment practices. The Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB) union said it planned to stage socially distanced protests in five towns and cities across England on Wednesday. “I’m going on strike for my basic rights and those of all the other riders struggling to get by and support families on Deliveroo poverty pay,” said Greg Howard, a Deliveroo rider and the chair of the IWGB’s couriers and logistics branch. He added: “I’ve seen conditions decline for years and then working through lockdown I contracted Covid-19 and got very little support from Deliveroo. After the pandemic, more people than ever understand this exploitation is no way to treat anyone, let alone key workers. The turning of the tide is clear. It’s time for rights for riders.” The news comes at a difficult time for Deliveroo. In March, a survey of more than 300 couriers showed they can earn as little as £2 an hour. After the news broke, several institutional investors declined to get involved in Deliveroo’s initial public offering, with some citing the firm’s record on workers’ rights as a key concern. “A lot of employers could make a massive difference to workers’ lives if they guaranteed working hours or a living wage, and how companies behave is becoming more important,” said David Cumming, the chief investment officer of Aviva Investors.
