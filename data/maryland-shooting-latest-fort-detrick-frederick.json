The shooter, a navy hospital corpsman, is deceased.” At a press conference, the Frederick police chief, Jason Lando, said the victims and the suspect were all adult males. The medic shot two people at the Riverside Tech Park then drove 10 minutes to the base where he was shot and killed, Lando said.

Fort Detrick spokeswoman Lanessa Hill said the gunman drove through a gate at an entrance to the base before base personnel confronted him on a road. She said Frederick police had given the base advance notice, “so we knew that we was out there.” Fort Detrick is a US army base that is home to the military’s flagship biological defense laboratory and several federal civilian biodefense labs. Both victims were airlifted to the Baltimore shock trauma center. Lando said: “We have two different scenes. All I can tell you is that we have confirmed there is only one shooter.
