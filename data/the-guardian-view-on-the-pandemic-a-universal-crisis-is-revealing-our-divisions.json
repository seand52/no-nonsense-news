The government has faced condemnation for not vaccinating millions living under its military control. (It inoculated 100,000 who work in Israel or its settlements.) Meanwhile, India recorded its biggest ever one-day tally of new cases on Monday: more than 100,000. Europe is struggling with a third wave. And in Latin America, a surge in the virus has hit even Chile, which ranks third in the world for vaccinations per capita.
